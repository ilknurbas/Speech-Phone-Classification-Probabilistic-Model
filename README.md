# Speech-Phone-Classification-Probabilistic-Model

 This repository contains materials for a task focusing on building a phone classifier for speech feature frames using a parametric probabilistic model. The task is to classify speech features into phonetic categories based on statistical models. It starts with a single parametric distribution (such as a Gaussian distribution) to model each phone class, and later extends to a mixture model comprising multiple parametric distributions. The goal is to implement classifiers using **multivariate Gaussian distributions and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), applying the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm**for training the models. MATLAB is used for all computations, and tasks include data pre-processing, classifier training, and inference scripts. The task uses the LibriSpeech dataset for classifier implementation. *Note that some sections of the codes are based on templates provided.*
